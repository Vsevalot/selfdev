QUESTIONS:
- Isn't it weird that _get_async returns all pages at once?
- Can I make a single wrapper for both sync and async functions?
- What is the type hint for async stopwatch?
- defaultdict(lambda: 0) ... rly? I just want a default 0
- PR and Issue relations. PR is basically an issue. Now I just use params from
issues. It looks wrong. But I don't want to duplicate code.
- Isn't there too many for the Github client?
- Sorting in dunder str doesn't look good
